    wrapped function can provide a column (or whatever) to be added to some
    mapped class, but it can also do some further setup after the class is
    fully constructed.

    Because the two steps may happen some time apart, the wrapped function may
    be a generator, yielding the object it wants to "return" into the class
    body.  The generator will later be sent the entire class to do with as it
    pleases.

    The wrapped function will be passed one extra initial argument: the name
    it's assigned to in the containing class.

    This is mostly useful for adding multiple things to a class, adding event
    listeners to attributes, or other setup that doesn't work while the class
    is being constructed and thus can't work with `declared_attr`.  Consider it
    a way to do `__declare_first__` or `last` without touching the class
    itself.  For example:
